    <h2> Traditional Chinese Festival</h2>
    <h3 id = "s1">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Chinese New Year, also known as the "Spring Festival"
      (simplified Chinese 春节; traditional Chinese 春節; Pinyin: Chūn Jié)
      in modern Mainland China, is an important Chinese festival celebrated
      at the turn of the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. Celebrations
      traditionally run from the evening preceding the first day, to
      the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first calendar month.
      The first day of the New Year falls on the new moon between 21 January
      and 20 February. In 2017, the first day of the Chinese New Year is
      on Saturday, 28 January, initiating the year of the Rooster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Year festival is centuries old and gains significance
      because of several myths and traditions. Traditionally, the festival
      was a time to honor deities as well as ancestors. Chinese New Year
      is celebrated in countries and territories with significant Chinese
      populations, including China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
      Vietnam, Cambodia, Mauritius and Australia, and the Philippines.
      Chinese New Year is considered a major holiday for the Chinese and has
      had influence on the lunar new year celebrations of its geographic
      neighbours.
    </p>

    <h3 id = "s2">Dates in Chinese Lunar Calendar</h3>

    <p>
      The lunisolar Chinese calendar determines the date of Chinese New Year.
      The calendar is also used in countries that have been influenced by,
      or have relations with, China – such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam, though
      occasionally the date celebrated may differ by one day or even one moon
      cycle due to using a meridian based on a different capital city in a
      different time zone or different placements of intercalary months.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Gregorian calendar, Chinese Lunar New Year begins at the new moon
      that falls between 21 January and 20 February. The median date of Chinese
      New Year's Day is lichun (Chinese: 立春; literally: "start of spring") on
      4 or 5 February, the solar term next to Dahan (Chinese: 大寒; literally:
      "major cold"). In the Chinese calendar, winter solstice must occur in the
       11th month, which means that Chinese New Year usually falls on the
       second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an
       intercalary month intervenes). To determine whether a year has an
       intercalary month, one only needs to check whether Chinese New Year
       is within the month of January.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Gregorian Calendar dates for Chinese New Year from 1912 to 2101 are
      below, along with the year's presiding animal zodiac and its Stem-branch.
      The traditional Chinese calendar follows a Metonic cycle (like the modern
      Jewish Calendar), and returns to the same date in Gregorian calendar
      roughly. The names of the Earthly Branches have no English counterparts
      and are not the Chinese translations of the animals. Alongside the
      12-year cycle of the animal zodiac there is a 10-year cycle of heavenly
      stems. Each of the ten heavenly stems is associated with one of the five
      elements of Chinese astrology, namely: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and
      Water. The elements are rotated every two years while a yin and yang
      association alternates every year. The elements are thus distinguished:
      Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, etc. These produce a combined
      cycle that repeats every 60 years. For example, the year of the Yang
      Fire Rat occurred in 1936 and in 1996, 60 years apart.

    <h3 id = "s3"> Mythology </h3>

    <p>
      According to tales and legends, the beginning of the Chinese New Year
      started with a mythical beast called the Nian. Nian would eat villagers,
      especially children. One year, all the villagers decided to go hide from
      the beast. An old man appeared before the villagers went into hiding and
      said that he's going to stay the night, and decided to get revenge on the
      Nian. All the villagers thought he was insane. The old man put red papers
      up and set off firecrackers. The day after, the villagers came back to
      their town to see that nothing was destroyed. They assumed that the old
      man was a deity who came to save them. The villagers then understood that
      the Nian was afraid of the color red and loud noises. When the New Year
      was about to come, the villagers would wear red clothes, hang red
      lanterns, and red spring scrolls on windows and doors. People also used
      firecrackers to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came
      to the village again. The Nian was eventually captured by Hongjun Laozu,
      an ancient Taoist monk. The Nian became Hongjun Laozu's mount.

    <h3> Introduction </h3>

    <p>
      The Chinese zodiac is the classification scheme that assigns an animal
      to each year in a repeating twelve-year cycle. The 12-year cycle of
      Chinese zodiac is an approximation to the 11.86-year cycle of Jupiter,
      the largest planet of the solar system. It is a scheme and systematic
      plan of future action that relates each year to an animal and its reputed
       attributes according to a 12-year cycle. It and its variations remain
       popular in several East Asian countries including China, Vietnam, Burma,
       Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos and
       Thailand as well as the Buddhist calendar.
